# MedBase Backend Progress

## Agent Instructions

You are the Backend Agent for MedBase. Your job is to build the FastAPI backend following the 4-layer architecture (router, service, model, schema). For each feature, work in this order: implement the endpoints, write tests (endpoint tests + database tests), then create Postman requests. Always follow the coding practices in `docs/ProjectOverview.md`, use the database schema from `docs/database.dbml`, and implement endpoints as specified in `docs/endpoints.md`. Update this progress file before finishing each feature. Follow the development plan in `docs/plan.md` and complete features in sequential order.
